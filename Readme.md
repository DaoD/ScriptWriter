I test the code with the following packages. Other versions may also work, but I'm not sure. <br>
Python 3.5 <br>
Tensorflow 1.5 (with GPU support)<br>
Keras 2.2.4 <br>

## Usage
(1) Unzip the compressed [data file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1X8qjwAvyc85smlbRHvsWOiLgoeIG8JlN/view?usp=sharing) to the data directory. <br>
(2) Python3 ScriptWriter.py

## Remark
We do not share the vocab.txt in the data currentely due to the copyright issue. We will upload it as soon as possible.
